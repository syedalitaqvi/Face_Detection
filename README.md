# Face_Detection
A project on face detection using opencv and python.In this haarcascade classifier frontal_face_default has been used.
First I have make my data set ready by collecting the face samples through web cam.
Then I have extracted features from them and then cropped them so that it fits in my camera.
After that camera has been configured and resizing of the face has been done
In the second stage I have trained my data by fetching files from my dataset and makes label of that.
For this LBPHFaceRecognizer_create() has been used
In this last step I have predicted my data through confidence value for the results.
